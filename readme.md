## to implement:

### nn lib
* sigmoid (done)
* softmax (done)
* backward (done)
* test softamx (done)
* mnist is implemented
-----------

* derivative of softmax in combination with cross entropy loss (done)
* test network 



### Very important Observation:
* deeper netowrk needs smaller learning rate in order to converge correctly!
