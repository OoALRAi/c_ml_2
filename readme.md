## to implement:

### nn lib
* sigmoid (done)
* softmax (done)
* backward (done)
* test softamx (done)
* mnist is implemented
* solve a bug cause the one hot encoding to have multiple ones at once. (done)
-----------

* derivative of softmax in combination with cross entropy loss (done)
* test network 



### Very important Observation:
* deeper netowrk needs smaller learning rate in order to converge correctly!
